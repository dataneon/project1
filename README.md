## Challenges
For a while, the game was forming a stack of previous answers and responses that were appearing in `alert`s, so that by Question 5, the user would be getting `alert`s about the previous 4 questions. This was solved by (1) getting rid of `alert` in favor of a header, and (2) rewritting the `eventlistener` that listens for the user's clicks.

## Stretch goals
* Use an API to retrieve information about plants.
